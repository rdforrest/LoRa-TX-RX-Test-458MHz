  // -*- mode: C++ -*-
  // Example sketch showing how to create a simple messaging client (transmitter)
  // with the RH_RF95 class. RH_RF95 class does not provide for addressing or
  // reliability, so you should only use RH_RF95 if you do not need the higher
  // level messaging abilities.
  // It is designed to work with the other example LoRa9x_RX

   Thanks to Jonathan Askey for introducing this to me. RDF
   Fast and accurate PPM reader

   Note values will need to be halved to bring them back to real world values

   Note due to increased accuracy values are read to 0.5us
   To get the array values back to real world full 'us' values the array value must be divided by 2

  The LoRa SX1278 is not 5V friendly so do not supply 5V to it else the board will get damaged. Use 3.3V of Arduino to connect it to VCC pin. Connect all the GND pins to GND. Connect the RST pin to D9 and DIO0 to D2 of Arduino. Connect the SPI Pins NSS, MOSI, MISO, SCK to Arduino D10, D11, D12, D13 of Arduino respectively as shown in circuit diagram above.

  Notes from Wiki for Radio Lib:
  SPI modules: Module(cs, irq, rst, gpio). For example: RF69 rf = new Module(10, 2, 3);
  CS: this is the pin that's used as SPI chip select.
  IRQ: this is the interrupt pin, it's usually connected to external interrupt on Arduino. It's a fast way for the module to tell Arduino something has happened - for example, a packet was received. All SPI modules have at least one interrupt pin.
  RST: most modules have a hardware reset pin. If the module doesn't have a reset or chip enable pin (e.g. CC1101), set rst to RADIOLIB_NC.
  GPIO: this is the fourth possible pin. It's optional for most modules, but may be required for some. SX127x requires additional interrupt pin to perform CAD and blocking receive. SX126x also uses this pin as the BUSY indication pin. If not in use, this pin can be left unassigned, or set to RADIOLIB_NC.
