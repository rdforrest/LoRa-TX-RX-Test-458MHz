   RadioLib SX127x Receive with Interrupts Example

   This example listens for LoRa transmissions and tries to
   receive them. Once a packet is received, an interrupt is
   triggered. To successfully receive data, the following
   settings have to be the same on both transmitter
   and receiver:
    - carrier frequency
    - bandwidth
    - spreading factor
    - coding rate
    - sync word

   Other modules from SX127x/RFM9x family can also be used.

   For default module settings, see the wiki page
   https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib/wiki/Default-configuration#sx127xrfm9x---lora-modem

   For full API reference, see the GitHub Pages
   https://jgromes.github.io/RadioLib/

  Frequency set to 458.75 MHz and Bandwidth set to 62.5

  The LoRa SX1278 is not 5V friendly so do not supply 5V to it else the board will get damaged. Use 3.3V of Arduino to connect it to VCC pin. Connect all the GND pins to GND. Connect the RST pin to D9 and DIO0 to D2 of Arduino. Connect the SPI Pins NSS, MOSI, MISO, SCK to Arduino D10, D11, D12, D13 of Arduino respectively as shown in circuit diagram above.

  Notes from Wiki for Radio Lib:
  SPI modules: Module(cs, irq, rst, gpio). For example: RF69 rf = new Module(10, 2, 3);
  CS: this is the pin that's used as SPI chip select.
  IRQ: this is the interrupt pin, it's usually connected to external interrupt on Arduino. It's a fast way for the module to tell Arduino something has happened - for example, a packet was received. All SPI modules have at least one interrupt pin.
  RST: most modules have a hardware reset pin. If the module doesn't have a reset or chip enable pin (e.g. CC1101), set rst to RADIOLIB_NC.
  GPIO: this is the fourth possible pin. It's optional for most modules, but may be required for some. SX127x requires additional interrupt pin to perform CAD and blocking receive. SX126x also uses this pin as the BUSY indication pin. If not in use, this pin can be left unassigned, or set to RADIOLIB_NC.
